# CS-303-A2Q1

This program consists of a LinkedList Class with data members and functions, and a Student Struct that functions as the Nodes
of the LinkedList class object studentList in the main program.

When the program is run, it begins by saying that the list has been created and one student has been added using the push_back function of the LinkedList class
and outputs it to the user.
It then tells the user that another student has been added to the list using the push_front function and agains outputs the updated list to the user.

The program adds two more students using the push_back function, and outputs the 4 student list to the user.

The program then asks the user to add another student, asking for their name and the index they want to insert the student at. The insert() function is called,
and the updated list is outputted to the user. 

The program then asks the user to remove a student, asking for the index of the student they wish to remove. The remove() function is called, and the updated list is 
outputted to the user

To show the effectiveness of the front(), pop_front(), back() and pop_back() functions, the program tells the user that it  will show the first and last students 
in the list and the remove them. 

It then asks the user for the name of the student they wish to find. In the example provided in the screenshots, the student was not there, so an appropriate message 
was outputted. If the student would have been found, the index they were found at would have been outputted to the user. 

The list is then destroyed using the empty() function and the program ends.
